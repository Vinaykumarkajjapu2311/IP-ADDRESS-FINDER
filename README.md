Splay Tree Implementation for Network Router IP Address Management in C++
Purpose:

This C++ project demonstrates the use of a splay tree data structure to efficiently manage and search for IP addresses of devices connected to a network router. Splay trees are particularly well-suited for this task due to their self-balancing properties, which ensure fast search and insertion operations.

Implementation Details:

Data Structure: A splay tree is used to store the IP addresses of connected devices.
IP Address Representation: IP addresses are represented as 32-bit integers for efficient comparison and manipulation.
Data Packet Generation: Random data packets are generated to simulate network traffic and test the search functionality.
Search Operation: When a data packet arrives, the router uses the splay tree to efficiently search for the corresponding IP address based on the packet's destination information.
Splay Tree Properties: Splay trees automatically adjust their structure during search operations, ensuring that frequently accessed IP addresses are near the root of the tree for faster future searches.
Usage:

Compile the code: Use a C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) to compile the main.c file and any necessary header files.
Run the executable: Execute the compiled program to start the simulation.
Observe the output: The program will generate random data packets and display the search results, demonstrating the efficiency of the splay tree implementation.
Customization:

Adjust the number of devices: Modify the NUM_DEVICES constant to simulate different network sizes.
Change the IP address range: Adjust the IP address generation logic to match your specific network configuration.
Implement additional features: Consider adding features like IP address validation, security measures, or performance optimizations as needed.
Benefits of Using a Splay Tree:

Fast search and insertion: Splay trees offer efficient search and insertion operations, making them ideal for dynamic network environments.
Self-balancing: The self-balancing property of splay trees ensures that frequently accessed IP addresses are near the root, improving search performance over time.
Scalability: Splay trees can handle large numbers of IP addresses without significant performance degradation.
Additional Considerations:

Error handling: Implement proper error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected situations, such as invalid IP addresses or memory allocation failures.
Memory management: Pay attention to memory allocation and deallocation to avoid memory leaks and optimize performance.
Testing and debugging: Thoroughly test the code to ensure its correctness and identify potential issues.
